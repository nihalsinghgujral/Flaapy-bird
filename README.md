Gameplay
The gameplay of this Flappy Bird Clone is reminiscent of the original game. The player controls a bird's flight, navigating it through a series of openings between pipes. The bird automatically moves forward, and the player can make the bird flap its wings to gain altitude and avoid collision with the pipes. Each successful passage through a set of pipes earns the player one point. The game ends if the bird collides with the ground or a pipe.

Spacebar: Flap the bird's wings to gain altitude.
